"""
When to Use *args and **kwargs:
*args:
- Use *args when you donâ€™t know beforehand how many positional arguments a method might receive.
- Example: Passing a list of values for processing.

**kwargs:
- Use **kwargs when you want to handle a variable number of keyword arguments.
- Example: Setting optional attributes for a class.
